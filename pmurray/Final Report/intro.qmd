# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Provide a big picture introduction to your project.


Suggestes structure:

What are the key ideas that you need to introduce to the reader?
Is there some historical context that you can provide (e.g. what was known about the problem before the technique/approach that you have considered was developed).

Given that you have introduced the reader to some key background ideas, what are the aims of the work?

Please note that we offer a broad range of project and the aims will reflect this. For example, you might aim to:

 - work through a proof of a theorem
 - develop a mathematical model of some system (that you will have introduced above)
 - develop an implementation of a method to solve a certain class of problem
 - apply a technique in the analysis of a dataset
 -  etc.


By the end of the introduction, you should have placed your project in context and outlined what you are going to do.
